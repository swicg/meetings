# W3C Social Web Incubator Community Group Meetings Archive

This repository contains the meeting archives for the W3C-SWICG (Social Web
Incubator Community Group), including notes, audio files of recorded meetings,
and ancillary materials such as slide presentations.

If you would like to upload a recording of a CG meeting in addition to minutes, we recommend consent (ideally beforehand/on-list) to record. We also recommend the "local" recording option in jitsi, which produces and downloads a `.webm` file. To strip out just the audio or recompress/re-encode, we recommend using [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in the command line; [here](https://gist.github.com/protrolium/e0dbd4bb0f1a396fcb55) is a helpful cheat-sheet of flags and options for getting what you want out of `ffmpeg`.
