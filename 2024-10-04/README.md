# Minutes

1. Intros
2. Community announcements
   * Darius: Open Standards advocate inside the Harvard Applied Social Media
     Lab. Applied Social Media lab is interested in hosting convenings related
     to decentralized social media / SWICG kind of things. Also will be
     sponsoring Darius's work on the Social Media Schema Observatory.
   * [IndieWeb Berlin!](https://indieweb.org/2024/Berlin) has organized and
     opened up tickets for the event. Tickets are complimentary, two day barcamp
     stype unconference and hackathon for all things independent and social web.
     Excited to be in Germany which is a hotbed of social web activity, will be
     hosted at Mozilla Berlin.
   * Social Web Foundation: Evan is now working with SWF with the goal of
     improving the network and also the user experience. Not yet a W3C member
     but will be soon, for now Evan is participating as individual.
3. Social Web CG Charter discussion
    * Group has had great momentum in the last year but we need to make sure we have a charter
    * https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/pull/1
    * Evan: when we started the CG we still had the Social Web Working Group,
      when we started the CG we said "it will work [handwave] like the WG does".
      But that was 5 or 6 years ago. My question is what kind of timeframe are
      we hoping for in this discussion and approval?
        * Dmitri: anywhere between 2 to 4 weeks is my propsal, what do people think?
        * (discussion)
        * CG charters do not require W3C approval (probably)
        * __Proposal__: accept
          [PR #1](https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/pull/1) 
          as the basis for collaboration on building a charter
          * Outcome: **Resolved**
          * Bumblefudge (in chat): i think the important part is to make
            significant progress EACH OF THE 4 WEEKS on the various PRs so that
            next week we MIGHT be ready to ratify haha
            who wants me to PR on their behalf can just tag me in their issue
    * Evan: how are the WG and CG charters going to be related
      * Bengo: if we can use the CG charter as a platform which we can agree on
        high level WG goals, it will make everything easier
      * Bob Wyman (in chat):PRs work for coders, but given that this is
         "social" web, perhaps we should use Issues, which are easier for
         non-coders. Or, provide a "PRs for Dummy's".
          * Tantek (in chat): or file an issue?
          * Bumblefudge (in chat): yeah issues are pretty user-friendly. anyone
    * Emelia: how does this relate to the question of who the editor(s) for the
      spec is(are)?
      * Dmitri: the typical editor/chair selection for a WG is W3C staff
        appoints chairs, chairs appoint editor, based on community feedback
        generally. I would like to make this explicit rather than implicit for
        both the CG and the WG via elections. W3C has now set up a voting
        mechanism for members and held elections for one WG so at least there is
        precedent. For editors maybe a similar voting mechanism?
      * Emelia: on the voting procedure, I was involved in the Solid one. There
        was a comment from someone on the forums who was unhappy with how the
        Solid election went, there was a perception that Inrupt carried lots of
        weight and won a lot of board seats. Virginia ran as an independent
        without Inrupt supporting her so it's important to note that while she
        is Inrupt affiliated, she did not represent inrupt. We need to be clear
        whether a person represents an org, or whether they are independent
        regardless of org affiliation, _and hold them accountable to that_.
      * Tantek: corporate capture is a concern, and in our community we are
        highly sensitive to that in ways that other communities are not. Seems
        unlikely that we would let it get to that place, or that it would occur.
        For example I don't expect Mastodon folks change behavior from the past
        several years and suddenly show up and attempt capture, or another risk
        others have expressed is Meta showing up and attempting capture, and to
        be clear I have seen no sign of it, raising it because it is a concern
        that has been voiced. In my experience I don't see it happening. May
        want to consider if we need guardrails against any one company doing
        something like this.
      * Laurens: the presence of guardrails would support the legitimacy of the
        CG
    * Tantek: regarding choosing editors, we have so much work to do that
      whoever steps up to do the work ends up driving it, do-ocracy style
      * Emelia: counterpoint to Tantek's "those that can do, do", these tend to
        bias toward those who have the social and economic power to do so. BIPOC
        may not have the funding and availability to work on this stuff.
        Do-ocracy tends to favor those who already have social power.
      * Tantek: strongly agreed with Emelia's concerns and support active
        inclusiveness in our efforts. one thing groups have done to mitigate
        potential harms and enable more inclusion is accept and support
        co-editors on documents, allowing one editor to take a break if things
        come up, like when [life happens as we say in the IndieWeb
        community](https://indieweb.org/life_happens), allowing a co-editor to
        keep things moving for the group.
1. CC to WG item staging discussion
    * Dmitri: we have an opportunity to adopt a process. You may be familiar
      with TC-39 and the way they work. They have created a living language that
      they add features to continuously. Partly due to tooling like babel, but
      also due to their governance. They have a very good working process of
      here's how to propose a feature, identify a champion, and bring it through
      various stages to acceptance. We have a PR here with a [proposed
      process](https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/pull/4) (direct link
      to rendered doc:
      https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/blob/01bc8a9463d36513f79b2e36cbd8896fc7da360d/stage-process.md)
    * (much discussion)
    * plh: the staged approach implies that the CG is able to make decisions. We
      need a charter for the CG to be able to do that. Since this staging
      process involves a Working Group, this process must be approved by a
      Working Group. So we need charter for the CG and a chartered and existing
      WG to really make this work.
    * Evan: __proposal__ that we accept [PR
      #4](https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/pull/4) to begin work on a
      staging process for CG/WG.
      * bumblefudge: WG as mentioned in the proposal is not necessarily a Social
        Web WG, maybe a different WG if it's related to cryptography or
        something else
      * Emelia: can we include FEPs as a more formal part of the process here?
        Some encouragement to use processes we have already voted on
        * Tantek: the staged process should at least mention existing processes
          (FEPs etc.) and how we intend to work with them.
      * Tantek: I reviewed the diffs from the FedID proposal and I agree with
        many of them, great work. But changing the "small features" description
        to "small decisions" would bite us badly, that's not what stages are
        for. The whole point is a way to grow and test and mature new ideas,
        rather than stage every small decision. We need to be able to make many
        small decisions in quick succession, for example the success of Evan's
        ActivityPub triage sessions, imagine if we had stage each decision made
        in every one of those sessions. (bumblefudge: agree, please open a PR)
      * __resolved__ to merge PR after the requested changes from Tantek (small
        features vs decisions) and Emelia (more explicit mention of previously
        voted up on processes)
    - **RESOLVED**: Accept
      [PR#4](https://github.com/swicg/potential-charters/pull/4) to begin the
      collaboration on a staging process for CG/WG (conditional on Tantek and
      Emelia's change requests).
1. Potential WG charters
    * to be discussed next meeting
